\section{caravan analogy}
\begin{itemize}
	\item cars "propagate" at 1000km/h
	\item toll booth takes 1m to service a car
	\item \textit{Will cars arrive to 2nd booth before all cars serviced at 1st booth?}
\end{itemize}
After 7m, 1st car at 2nd booth and 2 cars still at 1st.
\textit{1st bit of packel can arrive at} %....}


\paragraph{nodal delay} d(nodal) = d(processing) + d(queue) + d(transmission) + d(propagation).
